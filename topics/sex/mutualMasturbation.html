    <div id = "side">
      <h2 id = "titler">Mutual Masturbation</h2>
      <p>Simply put, mutual masturbation is just masturbation but with someone else! In other words, it’s when partners masturbate simultaneously or watch while another masturbates. While masturbation is usually thought of as something you do with yourself, there are many benefits of masturbating with your partner(s).</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Why should you try mutual masturbation?</h2>
      <p>There are a number of reasons why mutual masturbation might be right for you. Here are a few of those reasons:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	It’s the safest form of sex and decreases the risk of STI transmission almost entirely (assuming that you are careful about fluids that might come out during the activity)</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	It’s incredibly intimate</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	You know what you like so there’s a greater guarantee of reaching climax</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	It helps your partner(s) learn what works for you</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	It can be done virtually (reminder that consent applies to virtual situations as well)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">How do you mutually masturbate?</h2>
      <p>There are various methods, tips, and tricks for ensuring a good mutual masturbation experience. </p>

      <div id = "smaller">
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Communication is key</h3>
        <p>Keep in mind that you are showing someone something that is normally private and vice versa. Communicate all of your nerves, concerns, and questions with your partner(s) - this will ensure that everyone is comfortable and can really let loose.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Try different positions</h3>
        <p>Get creative! There are a number of different positions you can try but here are some that we recommend starting with:</p>

        <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Lie down next to each other. This can be a really good place to start if you have never tried mutual masturbation before because it doesn’t require eye contact (but gives you the option!)</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Try a masturbation take on missionary. Someone can lie down on their back while another straddles or kneels on top. This is a super sexy position because you get a great view and you are facing each other.</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Sit facing each other! This has a lot of the same intimate perks as the one above such as eye contact and a clear view of what is happening</li>
      </ul>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Dirty talk</h3>
        <p>Just because you might not be touching your partner(s) doesn’t mean that you can’t turn them on in different ways. Dirty talk can help elevate the experience of mutual masturbation. Just remember that for dirty talk to be ~sexy~ everyone involved must have their boundaries respected and feel comfortable participating. </p>
