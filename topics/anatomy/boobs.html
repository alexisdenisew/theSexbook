      <h2 id = "titler">What are boobs?</h2>
      <p>Boobs, breasts, tits, mammary glands, bosoms, bust, rackâ€¦ whatever you call them, what are they? Simply put, boobs are the fatty tissue found in the chest region, laying over top of the pectoral muscles and found most typically in a pair, each with a nipple. Everyone has breast tissue, although for many AFAB the breast tissue will develop further during puberty as well as glands that are capable of producing milk. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Common Conditions and Disorders</h2>
      <p>According to the Cleveland Clinic, approximately 1 in 8 women receive a breast cancer diagnosis in their lifetime, making it the number one threat to breast health. Other conditions include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Non Cancerous breast disease</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Breast cysts</li><br><br>

        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Nipple discharge</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">How to Keep Track of Your Breast Health</h2>
      <p>Mammograms play a key role in detecting breast cancer early. A mammogram is an x-ray that allows doctors to look for abnormal changes in breast tissue. While recommendations vary depending on risk factors, Mayo Clinic recommends that at age forty, those with breasts should get their first screening and continue to do so annually. Self breast exams can familiarize you with how your breasts look and feel so you can detect potential problems easier.</p>


      <h2 id = "titler">How to Self-Conduct a Breast Exam:</h2>
      <p><span style = "font-weight: 900">Step 1:</span> Look at breasts in the mirror with shoulders straight and arms on your hips</p>
      <p>Look for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	breasts that are their usual size, shape, and color</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	breasts that are evenly shaped without visible distortion or swelling</li><br><br>
      </ul>

      <p>If you see any of the following, consult a doctor:</p>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	dimpling, puckering, or bulging of the skin</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	nipple that has changed position or an inverted nipple</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	redness, soreness, rash, or swelling</li>
      </ul>

      <!-- span for bolded words -->

      <p><span style = "font-weight: 900">Step 2:</span> Raise your arms and look for the same changes</p>

      <p><span style = "font-weight: 900">Step 3:</span> Look for signs of fluid coming out of one or both nipples (could be watery, milky, or yellow fluid or blood)</p>

      <p><span style = "font-weight: 900">Step 4:</span> Feel breasts while laying down, using your right hand to feel your left breast and visa-versa. Use a firm touch with the pads of your fingers while keeping the fingers flat and together. In a circular motion, cover the entire breast from top to bottom, side-to-side. Go from the collarbone to the top of the abdomen and from the armpit to cleavage.</p>

      <p>Feel for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	any lumps or unevenness</li>
      </ul>

      <p><span style = "font-weight: 900">Step 5:</span> Feel the breasts while standing or sitting. Cover entire breast using same hand movements described in step 4, feeling for any unusual lumps.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Assigned Male at Birth (AMAB) Boobs:</h2>
      <p>During puberty, high testosterone and low estrogen levels stop breast development. However, the anatomy is still made up of:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Nipples</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Areolae</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Fatty Tissue</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Connective/Fibrous Tissue</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Lymph Nodes</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Few Undeveloped Milk Ducts</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047; Few Lobules (Most often Absent)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Health Concerns:</h2>
      <p>While breast cancer can still occur, it is far more rare in boobs with less developed breast tissue. A more common condition is gynecomastia in which the breast tissue becomes enlarged (usually caused by hormone imbalances). While gynecomastia is usually benign and reversible, it is important to see your doctor to check for any underlying diseases.</p>
