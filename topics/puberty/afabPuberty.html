      <h1 id = "topper1">AFAB Puberty Timeline</h1>
    </div>

    <div id = "side">
      <h2 id = "titler">Assigned Female at Birth (AFAB) Puberty</h2>
      <p>It is important to remember that everybody may have a different experience of puberty. There is a wide range of experiences within the puberty timeline, and no two people will develop in the same way, or at the same time. Nevertheless, there is a general timeline of changes that those who are assigned female at birth (AFAB) can expect to see during puberty.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Breast Development</h2>
      <p>The development of “breast buds” is one of the first signs that puberty has begun. These “breast buds” usually feel like a small lump around the nipple and will eventually develop into actual breasts. In the United States, this generally begins around ages 8-13. However, everyone develops at different rates with some beginning to develop earlier or later than others. All breasts are great regardless of size and shape. Also remember that it is very normal for each breast to develop at different paces (aka, one boob might be larger than the other) - this isn’t a cause for concern!</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Pubic Hair</h2>
      <p>When puberty begins, more hair will start to grow on the body. Not only will more hair grow on the arms, legs, armpits, and butt but hair will also grow in the pubic region. The pubic region includes the labia, mons pubis, and parts of the inner thighs. Usually, pubic hair is slightly darker than the hair on the head. Some people have more hair that goes further down their legs while others don’t - both are totally normal and are usually the results of genetics. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Should I shave my pubic hair?</h2>
      <p>Society has unfortunately turned pubic hair for those AFAB into some kind of fashion trend, often putting pressure on people to shave or to not shave depending on what’s “in” at the time. Bodies are not a trend, so everyone should do whatever they are comfortable with. </p>


      <h2 id = "titler">Vaginal Discharge</h2>
      <p>One of the most prevalent parts of AFAB puberty is the production of vaginal discharge. Vaginal discharge is the vagina’s way of cleaning itself. Some will experience vaginal discharge anywhere within a year before their first period. Vaginal discharge is generally clear or white and is a normal response to increases in hormones. The consistency of vaginal discharge may also change to reflect different levels of fertility. For example, discharge that is thick typically appears when fertility is low, and discharge that is more of a liquid usually appears when fertility is high. Normal discharge can be odorless or have a smell. However, a drastic change in odor along with burning or itching should be further investigated by a doctor. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Menstruation </h2>
      <p>The first period is generally around 2-3 years after the beginning of breast development. Although the average age of first period in the US is 13 years old, there is a wide range of normal, including anywhere between 8 to 16 years old. Many will experience irregular cycles for the first 5 years of having a period. This is common and not something to be worried about! The body is adapting to rapid changes.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Menstruation products:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Pads - Stick to underwear to absorb blood</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Tampons - Inserted into the vagina to absorb blood</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Menstrual Cup - Inserted into the vagina to collect blood</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Period Underwear - Reusable underwear designed to absorb blood (can be worn alone or as extra protection with tampons or cups)</li>
      </ul>
      

      <h2 id = "titler">Body</h2>
      <p>During puberty, body shapes change, and the percentage of body fat increases. This is essential as body fat protects vital organs, stores vitamins, insulates bodies, and allows cells to function. The hips may become wider and the waist may become smaller. Height will also increase with the fastest rate of growth being within the 6 months before the first period. On average, those AFAB grow 2-3 inches a year starting the year their period begins until they reach their adult height.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Hormones</h2>
      <p>Hormones are chemical messengers in the body that signal important processes like sleeping, eating, and growing. Starting as early as 7 or 8 years old, the body begins to produce hormones that will eventually lead to puberty. Both AFABs and AMABs produce the luteinizing hormone (LH) and the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). For those AFAB, LH and FSH help produce the primary sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone. These hormonal shifts trigger menstrual cycles which can bring about anxiety, sleeplessness, sadness and irritability during menstruation - this is also referred to as PMS (premenstrual syndrome). </p>

      <br>

      <p>Hormones directly affect mood. Estrogen, for example, regulates both serotonin and endorphins in the brain. So, it makes sense that during puberty, especially during periods, moods might feel like they are all over the place. This is normal! However, if moods become even more intense or pervasive, it might be representative of larger mental health concerns, such as anxiety and/or depression. Talk to a doctor or a trusted adult about next steps and proper care.</p>
