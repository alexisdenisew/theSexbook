    </div>

    <div id = "side">
      <h2 id = "titler">Contraception</h2>
      <p>When and if you choose to engage in sexual activities, it is important to know about the different contraceptive methods available to you. Depending on the contraceptive method, contraception can prevent sexually transmitted infections and/or pregnancy.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Barrier Methods</h2>
      <p>In general, barrier methods of contraception are affordable and effective in preventing both STIs and pregnancy. There is a wide range of barrier methods, so we’ve listed and defined them below!</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Dental Dams</h2>
      <p>The dental dam is a great barrier method to be used during any form of oral sex. A dental dam is a small square shaped piece of latex that can help prevent the spread of germs and STIs during oral sex. The dental dam should be placed over your (or your partner’s) vulva or anus prior to oral sex. Dental dams come in all different colors and flavors which can make oral sex fun and enjoyable! Like other barrier methods, dental dams should only be used once and should be disposed of after sexual activity.</p>

      <div id = "smaller">
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How much do dental dams cost? </h3>
        <p>On average, dental dams cost around $2 per individual dental dam.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Where can I buy a dental dam?</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, dental dems are not quite as easy to find as external condoms. However, you will likely be able to find them at your local drug store and planned parenthood health centers. </p>

      </div>

      <h2 id = "titler">External Condom</h2>
      <p>The external condom is a thin and stretchy pouch that is slipped over the penis before sexual activity. If worn correctly, the external condom can be incredibly effective at preventing both STIs and pregnancy. Using an external condom during oral, anal and vaginal sex can decrease your chances of contracting an STI. This is because the external condom prevents semen from entering another person. An unfortunate downside of condoms is that they could break due to a lack of lubrication. To prevent the condom from breaking use a water based lubricant before sexual activities. External condoms can only be used once.</p>

      <div id = "smaller">
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How much do external condoms cost?</h3>
        <p>On average, external condoms cost $2 per condom. However, you can often get external condoms for free at Planned Parenthood health centers, community health centers and doctor’s offices.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How old do I have to be to buy an external condom?</h3>
        <p>There is no age limit! </p>

        <br>
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How effective are external condoms at preventing pregnancy?</h3>
        <p>If you wear the condom correctly, they are 98% effective at preventing pregnancy. However, due human error external condoms are only 85% effective, so it can be a good idea to use another contraceptive method to fully protect yourself against pregnancy. </p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Where can you buy an external condom? </h3>
        <p>Your local drugstore, Planned Parenthood health centers, community health centers, doctors offices and supermarkets. Some school health centers might also provide external condoms!</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">When do you put the external condom on?</h3>
        <p>Before each time you have oral, anal or vaginal sex.</p>

      </div>


      <h2 id = "titler">Internal Condom</h2>
      <p>The internal condom offers the same kind of protection that the external condom offers. The only difference is that the internal condom goes inside a vagina or anus. They can be used to prevent STIs and/or pregnancy. In general, the internal condom looks similar to the external condom as well.</p>

      <div id = "smaller">
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How much do internal condoms cost?</h3>
        <p>In general, internal condoms cost $2-$3 per internal condom, however you can often find them for free.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Where can you buy an internal condom?</h3>
        <p>Your local drugstore, Planned Parenthood health centers, community health centers, doctors offices and supermarkets. Some school health centers might also provide internal condoms!</p>

        <br>
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">When do you put the external condom on?</h3>
        <p>Before each time you have anal or vaginal sex. </p>

      </div>

      <h2 id = "titler">Preventative Methods</h2>
      <p>Another form of contraception is pregnancy prevention methods. Unlike barrier methods, preventative methods need to be either prescribed or put in place by your doctor. Also, while these all protect against pregnancy, none of these methods protect you against STIs so it is a good idea to still use some kind of barrier method along with your preventative method. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Birth Control Pill </h2>
      <p>There are two different kinds of birth control pills: the combined oral contraceptive pill and the progestin only pill. Both are hormonal pills, that when taken daily, can prevent pregnancy.</p>

      <div id = "smaller">
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill (COC)</h3>
        <p>This is the most common type of birth control pill. The pill is made up of both estrogen and progestin hormones. These hormones stop your body from ovulating. When your body is not ovulating then there is no egg for the sperm to fertilize. While it is an effective form of pregnancy prevention, many people go on the pill for reasons totally unrelated to pregnancy; the pill can help with acne control and lessen the effects of a period.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Progestin Only Pill (POP)</h3>
        <p>While the COC is deemed as more effective, some people prefer the progestin only pill if they are hypersensitive to estrogen. You should talk to your doctor about which pill would be more effective for you. The POP is only effective if you take it at the exact same time everyday. </p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How does it work?</h3>
        <p>When taken daily, at the same time, the pill can effectively prevent pregnancy. However, if the pill is not taken consistently, then the effectiveness of this birth control method decreases dramatically.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>Anywhere between $0-$50 depending on your insurance.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How can you start the pill?</h3>
        <p>There are a couple of different ways that you can start the pill. The most common way is to talk to your doctor about starting the pill and exploring whether or not this birth control method will work well for you. If you do not have a general doctor (or are in the process of looking for one), you can go to a Planned Parenthood health center to explore your birth control options. Another really easy way to get birth control (that is also really affordable) is by using the online delivery apps. Below are some ones that we recommend:</p>

        <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Nurx is an birth control online birth control service that aims to take the stress out of the birth control process. You simply select your birth control of interest and answer a few questions. A medical provider will prescribe one of the options and it will be delivered to you for free.</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	The Pill Club is another online birth control service. Similar to Nurx, you fill out an online survey that is reviewed by medical professionals. The birth control they provide is free with insurance and is given to you at the best price (sometimes as low as $9) without. The Pill Club also delivers your birth control straight to your home, taking the stress out of prescription refills etc. They also send goodies like stickers and tampons in every delivery.</li>
      </ul>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How can you increase the effectiveness of the pill?</h3>
        <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Set an alarm on your phone to make sure you take it everyday at the same time</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Plan ahead so that you don’t forget to refill your prescription</li>
      </ul>

      </div>

      <h2 id = "titler">Hormonal and Copper IUDs</h2>
      <p>The hormonal and copper IUDs are small devices implanted into your uterus by your doctor to prevent pregnancy. It is a long term birth control method that usually lasts up to 12 years, but can vary depending on the type of IUD. </p>

      <div id = "smaller">
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How effective is the IUD at preventing pregnancy?</h3>
        <p>The IUD is roughly 97% effective at preventing pregnancy</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>It can cost anywhere between $0-$1,300 depending on your insurance.</p>

      </div>

      <h2 id = "titler">The Vaginal Ring</h2>
      <p>The vaginal ring - also referred to as the NuvaRing or ANNOVERA - is a low maintenance and effective form of contraception. The ring goes inside of your vagina and helps prevent pregnancy by releasing hormones. It is worn 24/7 and should only be taken out when you are changing the ring. The NuvaRing should be worn for 5 weeks before changing it and the ANNOVERA lasts for a year.</p>

      <div id = "smaller">
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How effective is the ring?</h3>
        <p>It is 91% effective at preventing pregnancy.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>It can cost anywhere between $0-$200 depending on your insurance.</p>

      </div>

      <h2 id = "titler">The Patch</h2>
      <p>The patch is highly effective at preventing pregnancy if worn correctly. Like other contraception methods, a prescription is required to use the patch. The patch is worn on your stomach, lower back or butt and releases hormones to stop ovulation and consequently, prevent pregnancy. The patch needs to be changed once a week in order to be effective. </p>

      <div id = "smaller">
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How effective is the patch?</h3>
        <p>It is 91% effective at preventing pregnancy.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>It can cost anywhere between $0-$150 depending on your insurance. </p>

      </div>

      <h2 id = "titler">The Implant</h2>
      <p>Like the IUD, the implant is a long lasting birth control method with low maintenance required. The implant is a small rod that releases hormones in your body. It is inserted into your arm by your doctor and, in general, the implant is effective for up to 5 years. </p>

      <div id = "smaller">
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How effective is the implant?</h3>
        <p>It is 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>It can cost anywhere between $0-$1,300 depending on your insurance. </p>
        

      </div>
      

      <h2 id = "titler">Emergency Contraception</h2>
      <p>You might consider taking emergency contraception if you don’t want to get pregnant and have done any of the following:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	You had unprotected sex and you are not on any form of preventative birth control</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	The condom broke during sexual intercourse</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	You forgot to take your birth control pill and then had unprotected sex</li>
      </ul>

      <br>

      <p>Emergency contraception is a single pill, often referred to as “Plan B” or “the morning after pill” and can decrease the likelihood of an unplanned pregnancy after sex. Although you can technically take Plan B up to five days after unprotected sex, but it is better to take it within the first 72 hours. The sooner you take the pill, the more effective it will be. It is important to remember that emergency contraception is to be used in emergency situations, and should not be used as a primary form of birth control.</p>

      <div id = "smaller">
        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Where can you buy the morning after pill?</h3>
        <p>You can buy the morning after pill at any pharmacy or Planned Parenthood health center. </p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">How much does it cost?</h3>
        <p>It generally costs  somewhere between $12-$50. </p>
