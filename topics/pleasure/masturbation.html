      <h2 id = "titler">What is masturbation?</h2>
      <p>Masturbation, aka solo sex, is the act of pleasuring oneself. Despite what society might tell you, it is incredibly normal to masturbate. Masturbation can actually increase the pleasure experienced in sexual encounters with someone else because you know what works for you. It’s also the safest form of sex because it doesn't carry the risks of pregnancy and/or STIs.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Let’s erase the stigma.</h2>
      <p>For those lucky enough to learn about masturbation in school, it is still all too common to only learn about masturbating with a penis and not a vulva. Related to the partnered orgasm gap, there is a gendered masturbation gap that perpetuates stigma around masturbation for those with vulvas. We want to change this; While there is no pressure to masturbate, there should also be no shame in doing so either.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">How do you masturbate?</h2>
      <p>Everyone has their own methods and techniques for masturbation, but for those who have never masturbated before, here is a good place to start. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Erase any shame surrounding masturbation</h2>
      <p>It can be difficult to fully enjoy a solo sex session if there are feelings of shame or guilt for engaging in it. Remember that masturbating is incredibly normal and that many people do it. </p>


      <h2 id = "titler">Stick with it!</h2>
      <p>The first time you masturbate might not be great or end in an orgasm, that’s ok! Remember, there are so many different ways to masturbate; you might just need to try a few more to figure out what works for you.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Set the mood</h2>
      <p>Make sure you are in a comfortable environment. Create an arousing ambiance. Maybe turn on some sexy music, turn off the light or put on a sexy outfit. Watch ethical porn (see page). If you don’t want to watch porn, find a sex scene in a movie you love.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Switch up positions</h2>
      <p>Just like in sex with another person, change up your position.</p>
      

      <h2 id = "titler">Watch yourself</h2>
      <p>Masturbate in front of a mirror so you can see everything and everything going on. This can feel incredibly empowering.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Focus on the feeling</h2>
      <p>Try to remove the pressure of orgasming and instead concentrate on how you are feeling in the moment.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Stimulate your erogenous zones</h2>
      <p>In addition to the clitoris, vagina, and penis - play with your other erogenous zones. There are a plethora of erogenous zones but some good ones include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Neck</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Nipples</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Lips</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Ears</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Masturbation with a Penis</h2>
      <p>Here are some tips for masturbating with a penis:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Try some different positions. Some good ones for people with penises might be a) leaning against a wall with your hips pushed out, b) getting onto all fours, c) lying down, d) sitting up</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Switch your hands. Not only will this prevent one hand from getting tired or sore, but it might also lead to different sensations.</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Dry hump and move your hips. This can simulate having sex and increase the sensations you experience.</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Try different strokes! You might have tried going up and down with your hands, but you could also try using your whole hand or only a few fingers. You could also try different twisting strokes from the base of the penis to the top.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Masturbation with a Vagina</h2>
      <p>Here are some tips for masturbating with a vulva and vagina:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Stimulate the clitoris. You can do this in a number of ways, but a good place to start is by moving your fingers in a circular motion around the clitoris. You can start getting faster as you get closer to climax. </li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	If you want to stimulate the G-spot, try the “come hither” motion with your fingers inside your vagina. </li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Touch yourself! Play with your nipples or other erogenous zones during solo sex. </li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Try some different positions. Maybe lie on your back, squat, or even get on all fours. </li>
      </ul>
