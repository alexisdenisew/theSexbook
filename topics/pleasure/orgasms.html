    </div>

    <div id = "side">
      <h2 id = "titler">Orgasms</h2>
      <p>On a biological level, orgasms can be described as the rhythmic stimulation of highly sensitive body parts / erogenous zones. Usually, orgasms are achieved through the stimulation of genitals. However, achieving an orgasm is not limited to stimulating genitalia. In fact, it is possible to orgasm from stimulation of other body parts (i.e. nipples) and even through thought alone. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Sexual Response</h2>
      <p>The sexual response can be divided into 4 stages: </p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Excitement</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Plateau of arousal</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Orgasm</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Resolution</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">What happens in the excitement phase?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Increased blood flow to genitalia </li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Heartbeat and breathing increase (almost simulating what happens when you exercise!)</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	The nervous system is engaged and sends “enjoyment” messages to the the brain's reward system</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Nerve endings relay pleasure signals to the brain</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">What happens in the plateau of the arousal phase?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Contractions in erogenous zones</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Experience intensifies</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	You are on the brink of an orgasm in this phase</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">What happens in the orgasm phase?</h2>
      <p>If you have a penis, the anal sphincter, prostate gland and penis muscles will contract</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Contraction leads to ejaculation</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Roughly 3-10 seconds of intense pleasure</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Followed by a refractory period in which another orgasm cannot be achieved</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Vagina owners don’t experience a refractory period (can allow for multiple and consecutive orgasms)</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Orgasms last around 20 seconds</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Consists of rhythmic contractions of uterus, vagina, anus and pelvic muscles</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The brain takes control during an orgasm; dopamine (aka the happy chemical) is released in the brain, and so is oxytocin (the bonding and love chemical)</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	During an orgasm, activity in the amygdala and hippocampus goes down, lowering anxiety</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Often you can lose control during an orgasm</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">What happens in the resolution phase?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	The body experiences deep relaxation</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Heart rate slows to a resting pace</li>
      </ul>


      <h2 id = "titler">What does it feel like?</h2>
      <p>If you have never experienced an orgasm, it might be confusing to know what it feels like. Here are some good sources that describe what an orgasm might feel like for you.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">“What does an orgasm feel like?” by Come Curious</h2>
      <p>Best friends Florence and Reed started their youtube channel to talk about sex and everything that has to do with it. One of their best videos by far is “What does an orgasm feel like?”. Watch them describe the different sensations they have experienced during orgasm <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ef8E-5nC44" id = "linky" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">“17 Women get real about orgasms” by Teen Vogue</h2>
      <p>In this Teen Vogue article, 17 women open up about what an orgasm feels like for them. One woman describes an orgasm as, “Screaming for joy. Feeling everything and nothing at the same time,” and another describes it as “The stars emoji mixed with the explosion emoji.” To read more orgasm accounts look at the article<a href = "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-an-orgasm-feels-like" id = "linky" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
      

      <h2 id = "titler">Orgasming for people with penises</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Despite common misconception, you don’t have to ejaculate to orgasm with a penis.</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	If semen (white-ish liquid) comes out of your penis, then you have had an ejaculatory orgasm.</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Dry orgasms (or orgasms where you don’t ejaculate) are just as enjoyable as ejaculatory orgasms</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	You can also orgasm from the prostate. The prostate is a small gland located behind the rectum and in between the penis and your bladder. Many describe an orgasm from prostate stimulation as a whole body experience.</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	It really isn’t that different to a vaginal orgasm - vaginal orgasms just last roughly 20 seconds longer</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Orgasming for people with vaginas</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	An orgasm can either be through vaginal, clitoral or even cervical stimulation</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Clitoral orgasms are probably the most common and usually occur as a result of stimulating (rubbing or vibration) the clitoris</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Vaginal orgasms can be harder to achieve, however they do occur! It usually feels like a very intense climax that can be felt all over the body</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	A cervical orgasm can feel incredibly powerful and can often last for a long time. It occurs when the cervix is stimulated. The cervix is located around the end of the uterus, so it is a bit deeper in the body.</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	The vagina and uterus will contract rapidly during orgasm</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">The Orgasm Gap </h2>
      <p>Studies have shown that heterosexual sexual encounters betwen cisgendered men and women reveal a gendered orgasm gap. In these sexual encounters, men traditionally experience substantially more orgasms than women. In a study of 800 undergraduate students “91% of men versus 39% of women reported usually or always experiencing orgasm in partnered sex”. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Facts & Figures</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Lesbian women had a significantly higher probability of orgasm than did either heterosexual or bisexual women</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	The occurrence rate of orgasm did not vary by sexual orientation when it came to men</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Some research indicates that cisgendered heterosexual women set the bar for “good sex” incredibly low. In fact, many women descibe good sex as the absence of pain and degradation not the presence of pleasure or an orgasm</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">How to close the orgasm gap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Educate yourself and your friends about the orgasm gap</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	In sexual encounters, prioritize pleasure</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Acknowledge that the claims regarding biological female inability to orgasm are entirely false</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Masturbate! Figure out what you enjoy and then translate that to a partner</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Squirting </h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Squirting occurs when fluid is expelled from your urethra <a href = "https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/female-ejaculation#overview" id = "linky"target = "_blank">(source)</a></li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	About 14% of women say that they experience squirting alongside all or most orgasms <a href = "https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/female-ejaculation#overview" id = "linky" target = "_blank">(source)</a></li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	69.23% of women have experienced ejaculation during orgasm</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Ejaculate for women comes from the female prostate (aka Skene’s gland)</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	True ejaculation (or squirting) occurs with an orgasm, but some researchers have found that it can also occur with g-spot stimulation<a href = "https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/female-ejaculation#overview" id = "linky" target = "_blank">(source)</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Ejaculation vs. Squirting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Ejaculation is made up of prostate enzymes</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Fluid released via squirting is diluted urine and ejaculate fluid</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Female ejaculation is a thick, white tinted fluid that is released from the female prostate (aka the G-Spot)</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Cum or ejaculation comes from the urethra (looks whitish)</li>
      </ul>

      
      <h2 id = "titler">Different Types of Orgasms</h2>
      <p>There are many different types of orgasms that can arise from different types of stimulation. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Pressure Orgasm </h2>
      <p>Usually, the pressure orgasm occurs during solo-sex or masturbation. It occurs when pressure is applied indirectly to genitalia and other erogenous zones. This type of orgasm is actually most prevalent amongst children, who often unknowingly masturbate.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Multiple Orgasms</h2>
      <p>Simply put, multiple orgasms are a series of orgasms that occur, one after the other, in a short period of time. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Relaxation Orgasms</h2>
      <p>This type of orgasm occurs in a moment of intense and deep relaxation during stimulation. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Tension Orgasms</h2>
      <p>This is one of the most common types of orgasms. It occurs when the muscles and the body are tense during direct stimulation.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Fantasy Orgasms</h2>
      <p>As we mentioned before, the brain is overwhelmingly involved in how you experience pleasure during sexual activity. Something that you probably didn’t know is that orgasms can actually occur from mental stimulation alone.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">G-spot Orgasms</h2>
      <p>This is a type of orgasm that occurs when an erotic zone is stimualted during penatrative sex.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">What is the G-spot?</h2>
      <p>The G-spot is a small area, about an inch  inside the vagina. It’s on the upper wall of the vagina (which can be visualized as close to the belly button). While some vagina owners don’t notice a difference when their G-spot is stimulated, many do experience orgasms from stimulation and roughly 10% will ejaculate when their G-spot is stimulated. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Penetration vs. Stimulation</h2>
      <p>For people with vaginas, there are two kinds of orgasms. Both involve the clitoris!  One is achieved by stimulating the clitoris externally, and the other is achieved through the vaginal canal, which is actually stimulating the internal parts of the clitoris. <a href = "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/women-do-experience-two-different-types-orgasm-study-reveals-9191884.html" id = "linky" target = "_blank">(source)</a>.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Health Benefits of Orgasms</h2>
      <p>Not only are orgasms amazing because they feel great, they also are known to have a number of health benefits. Some of these include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Frequent orgasms have been found to decrease one’s risk of cancer and heart disease <a href = "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/232318#what-is-an-orgasm" id = "linky" target = "_blank">(source)</a>.</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They are good for your skin! When you orgasm, your brain releases oxytocin (happy chemical) and decreases the amount of cortisol (stress chemical). This combination makes it less likely that your skin will break out or develop stress related rashes. </li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Body confidence goes up! One study found that by focusing on how much pleasure your body can experience, you will actually start to associate your body with pleasure.</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	You can actually sleep better. After experiencing an orgasm, your body releases prolactin, a sleepy chemical, helping you fall asleep easily. It also releases oxytocin and vasopressin, both of which will help you better. </li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Orgasms can make you happier as the happy chemical, oxycontin, is released during climax.</li>
      </ul>
