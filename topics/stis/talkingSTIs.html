      <h2 id = "titler">How to talk to your partner about STIs</h2>
      <p>The best time for you to talk to your partner about STIs, past testing and future testing plans is before you engage in sexual activity. This does not mean that you should pop the question right as your underwear is coming off (although doing that is better than nothing). Instead, you should try to raise the question of STIs and testing before the sexual activity begins. Discussing STIs with your partner is just as much about your health as it is theirs. At first, you might feel like this conversation is awkward, but there is no reason it should be! Remember that it is not about whether or not you trust your partner - people with STIs, especially young people, are often asymptomatic. The best way to know is to get tested frequently for STIs. Therefore, if you’re sexually active, make getting STI tested a regular part of your doctor’s visits/yearly physicals.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Conversation Starters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	This is hard for me to talk about, and I understand that this can be a bit awkward, but I care about you and I think it's important. How do you feel about going to get tested for STIs together?</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	FYI, I got tested for STDs last month and I didn’t have anything. Have you ever been tested? I want us to make sure we’re taking care of each other.</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	I think it’s important to be honest, so I want to tell you that I got tested for STDs last month and found out I had chlamydia. I took medicine, and I don’t have it anymore. But it showed me how common and sneaky STDs are. Have you ever been tested? </li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Before we start, I wanted to let you know that I have been tested since my last sexual partner and my results were clean. When was the last time that you were tested?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If your partner refuses to get tested you may want to rethink your relationship with them.</p>
