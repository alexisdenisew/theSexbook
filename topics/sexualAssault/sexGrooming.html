      <h2 id = "titler">What is Sexual Grooming?</h2>
      <p>Sexual grooming is a methodical process in which a perpetrator manipulates a person to the point where they can be victimized. Essentially, grooming involves behaviors a predator uses in preparation for committing sexual abuse. These behaviors not only aim to manipulate the intended victim but the loved ones surrounding them as well. While circumstances vary, in all cases of sexual grooming the victim is never at fault. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Who is Susceptible? </h2>
      <p>First, it is important to understand that grooming can happen to anyone at any age and all cases must be taken seriously. That being said, some factors make one more susceptible to grooming than others. Here are just three examples of people vulnerable to sexual grooming:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Children/minors are at a higher risk, in fact, half of those who abuse children use grooming behaviors </li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	People who are gullible (very trusting) and insecure (low self-esteem/confidence)</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Members of certain religious groups/organizations </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Types of Grooming </h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Someone can be groomed online or in-person</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Someone can be groomed by a stranger or someone they know, Ex: Family member, friend, teacher, faith group leader, coach, employer, etc.</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Relationships a groomer can build: Romantic relationship, Mentor, Authority figure, Dominant/persistent figure</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Common Stages in Grooming</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Victim selection </li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Gaining Access: Offender separates victim emotionally/physically from others, (Specific to child sexual abuse) Half of family abuse cases take place in the child’s bedroom after everyone is asleep, predators take positions in communities where being in contact w/ a minor does not spark suspicion</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Trust Development: Abuser works to gain the trust of victim/victim’s family or friends, Abuser gives small gifts, special attention, or shares secrets in order to make the victim feel special, </li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Desensitization to touch: Generally the last stage before the actual abuse begins, Abuser increases nonsexual touching to “prepare” the victim</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Sexual Abuse: The sexual grooming techniques confuse the victim, Abuser may use threats/coercion once abuse starts so the victim does not report them, Abuser can gaslight the victim (tell them their feelings are unreasonable and crazy)</li>
      </ul>


      <h2 id = "titler">What are “Flying Monkeys”</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	An abuser may use others outside of the relationship w/ victim to inflict further harm or convince them to stay w/ the abuser</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Most often the “flying monkeys” have no idea they are being used to groom someone</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Used to dismiss victim’s concerns</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Signs of Grooming (these are not always obvious) </h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Being secretive about how they are spending their time</li> <br><br>

      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">What to do if you believe someone you know is being groomed?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Take steps to eliminate or limit their interaction with the person</li> <br><br>
