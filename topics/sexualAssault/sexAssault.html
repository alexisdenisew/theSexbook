      <h2 id = "titler">What is sexual assault?</h2>
      <p>Any form of sexual contact, act or behavior that occurs without explicit and uncoerced consent of the victim is sexual assault. In other words, sexual assault is any form of unconsented to sexual actions. It is a violation of your body, mind and overall trust. Hence, it is incredibly important that sexual assault is taken seriously and understood in depth. Although it is a difficult subject to study, understanding what sexual assault is can help you develop tools for preventing it from happening, protecting yourself, protecting your friends and avoid making detrimental mistakes of your own.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Why do I need to learn about sexual assault?</h2>
      <p>Other than “it’s just good to be educated” on sexual health, we have listed some reasons emphasizing why it is so important that you educate yourself on matters of sexual assault.</p>

      <div id = "smaller">

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">I. You will probably know someone who gets sexually assaulted.</h3>
        <p>In the United States, every 73 seconds an American is sexually assaulted, therefore the likelihood of someone you know being sexually assaulted is pretty high. Be a resource to these people. Sexual assault is a traumatic experience so being well versed in the subject can help you support them through a very difficult time.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">II. You will probably know someone who sexualy assaults someone.</h3>
        <p>Sexual assault is often committed by someone the survivor of sexual assault knows. In other words, sexual assaulters are not necessarily complete strangers. They could be someone you see around at school, a friend or even the survivor’s significant other. Knowing how to spot sexual assault and what it looks like can help you protect your friends.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">III. You might get sexually assaulted. </h3>
        <p>We hope this doesn’t happen but if it does, a comprehensive understanding of sexual assault can help you take the best care of yourself after the fact. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Dealing with the aftermath of a sexual assault</h2>
      <p>RAINN is an amazing organization that provides free resources for sexual assault survivors. Here at The Sexbook we highly reccommend everyone visits their <a href = "https://www.rainn.org" id = "linky" target = "_blank"> website </a> to learn even more about sexual assault. Survivors should follow this <a href = "https://www.rainn.org/after-sexual-assault" id = "linky" target = "_blank"> link</a> to see how RAINN can help you. In the case that you have just experienced a sexual assault, below are steps you can follow to begin the recovery process.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	If you are in immediate danger call 911</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Reach out to someone you trust for support</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Call the nation sexual assault hotline (800) 656-4673</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Visit online.rainn.org to chat anonymously if you are not comfortable calling the hotline</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Drugs and Alcohol</h2>
      <p>We know as teenagers and young adults you might be attending social events that have alcohol and drugs so it is important to consider consent in these situations. While drunk hookups can be fun and positive, you need to make sure all parties are still in their right mind when consenting to any sexual activities. Consent cannot be given by anyone who is incapacitated. </p>

      <br>

      <p>Signs of incapacitation:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Inability to speak coherently</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Inability to walk without assistance</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Passing out</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Confusion over basic facts (name, date of birth, day of week, etc…)</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Making decisions they would definitely not normally make</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the person you are vibing with at a party begins to show any of the signs above do not engage in any sexual activities. Additionally, if you see anyone at a party displaying any of these signs do not stand aside and let someone take advantage of them. Stepping in may feel uncomfortable to you or even scary, but it is better than letting an assault occur. Here are some excuses you can use to help keep them safe:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	“They have an early morning tomorrow so I am going to take them home” </li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	“We planned to uber / walk home together”</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	“They are staying at my place tonight so I will take them home” </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Even if your friend does not seem incapacitated, it is still important to check in with them if they are leaving the party or room with someone. Giving your friend a possible out can be very helpful. Not sure what to say? Here are some examples:</p>

      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	“Hey, I thought you were staying at my place tonight, are you still coming with me?”</li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	“Do you want to go to the bathroom with me really quick before you go?”</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	“I need some advice, can you come here for a second”</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	“Do you want to dance with me for a second”</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	“Will you come get a quick drink with me”</li>
      </ul>
