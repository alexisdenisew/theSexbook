    </div>

    <div id = "side">
      <h2 id = "titler">Relationship Abuse</h2>
      <p>Relationship abuse is a pattern of abusive behavior in relationships of any kind. Abuse can take many forms, including but not limited to: emotional, physical, sexual and financial. Sometimes people wonder if abuse is too strong of a word to describe what is happening in their relationship. Recognizing abuse is about recognizing how the relationship makes you feel. If you feel as though you are isolated, unsafe, don’t feel like you can speak up, communicate your concerns, or get out, you are likely in an abusive relationship.</p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Warning Signs of Abuse</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	You don’t feel safe around your partner </li> <br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	You are frequently anxious to hang out with them</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They are violent or aggressive </li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They can’t control their temper and become destructive of objects etc. when they are angry</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They threaten to hurt you or themselves if you don’t do something</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They blame you for their abusive behavior</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They pressure you in sexual activities</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They don’t respect your boundaries</li><br><br>
        <li id = "listITM">&#10047; They are controlling</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Emotional Abuse </h2>
      <p>Emotional abuse can occur in any type of relationship: romantic, platonic, familial, or sexual. It can also take place in relationships involving a power dynamic including the workplace or school. Emotional abusers control others by silencing, isolating, and discrediting them. Emotional abuse can create a cycle where the victim feels they can’t endure the relationship anymore, but are too afraid or worn down to leave. Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to recognize emotional abuse because it often takes form in subtle ways. </p>

      <h2 id = "titler">Elements of an Emotionally Abusive Relationship</h2>

      <div id = "smaller">

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Undermining</h3>
        <p>One form of emotional abuse is undermining. It can be seen in a variety of ways, such as consistently dismissing your opinion, disputing your point of view, and gaslighting. Sometimes, abusers will be extra kind to you after being hurtful in order to bury their abuse, and undermine your ability to express concerns.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Guilting</h3>
        <p>There are a variety of ways that an abuser can guilt a victim. This ranges from emotional blackmail (threatening to hurt oneself/having a disproportionate reaction to criticism) to the silent treatment. Abusers can withhold affection or time as a way to manipulate you into accepting their behavior.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Rule Making</h3>
        <p>Since emotional abuse is centered around control, extreme expectations and standards can turn into abusive behavior patterns. Rule making consists of someone restricting any of the following or more:</p>

        <ul>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	When and where you go</li> <br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Who you can see</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	How you dress</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	How you act</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	How you use your money</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Constant Criticism</h3>
        <p>Criticising your appearance, character, decisions, or anything else to a point where it damages your self-esteem can be considered a form of emotional abuse.</p>

        <br>

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Gaslighting </h3>
        <p>Gaslighting is a manipulation tactic used to make you question your memory or reality. As a result, gaslighting can be difficult to both recognize and escape. Here are some examples of gaslighting:</p>

        <ul>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They tell constant lies</li> <br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They will deny that they have said something even if you have proof and confront them about it</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They attack what is important to you </li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Their actions do not match what they say </li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They project their issues onto you and make you feel as if you are to blame</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They will try to turn people against you</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They try to blur the lines between what is good and bad</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They tell people you are crazy</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	They try to convince you that they are the only person in your life that you can trust</li>
        </ul>

      </div>


      <h2 id = "titler">Physical Abuse</h2>
      <p>Physical abuse - in romantic and/or sexual relationships - can be defined as a pattern of violence, aggression, coercion and assault. Often, physical abuse and emotional abuse are intertwined with one another, making it harder for the victim to escape an abusive relationship. If you are in an abusive relationship remember that it is not your fault and their abuse is not a reflection of you. </p>

      <div id = "smaller">

        <h3 id = "titler2" class= "true">Facts & Figures</h3>
        <ul>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	28% of rapes are committed by an intimate partner</li> <br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	In the United States, roughly 20 people are abused by a partner every minute</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	1 in 3 women have experienced some kind of violence from a partner</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	1 in 4 men have experienced some kind of violence from a partner</li>
        </ul>
        

      </div>

      <h2 id = "titler">Develop a Safety Plan</h2>
      <p>If you have identified that you are in an abusive relationship, it might be a good idea to develop a safety plan that can be put in effect if your situation becomes more dangerous and/or you want to try to leave that situation.</p>

      <ul>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Reach out to a trusted adult or friend: The first thing that you should do is to reach out to a trusted adult, friend, counselor, or teacher. They can be your ally and help you maneuver the relationship as you find safety.</li> <br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Determine safe places: It is important to identify safe places that you can go to if you are concerned for your safety. These places should be somewhere you could stay for a while (or until your situation becomes safer) and should not be known to your abuser. </li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Determine who you can trust: Identify close friends or family members that will protect you in a dangerous situation and keep your story confidential.</li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Trust your gut: You have already been enduring and surviving immense amounts of trauma. Don’t doubt yourself, you are stronger than you think. Especially in dangerous situations, trusting your gut can allow you to act quickly and ensure your safety. </li><br><br>
          <li id = "listITM">&#10047;	Come up with a code word: Share this word with your group of friends or family members that you can trust. This is a discrete way of alerting people close to you that you are not safe and need help. Another easy way to develop a safety plan is through the National Domestic Violence Hotline’s safety plan resource. This <a href = "https://www.thehotline.org/plan-for-safety/create-a-safety-plan/" id = "linky" target = "_blank">link</a> helps you develop a plan easily and discreetly</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 id = "titler">Resources for Survivors</h2>
      <p>If you have recently left an abusive relationship, or plan on doing so soon, it is important that you prioritize your mental and physical wellbeing. </p>
